This document provides guidelines for creating and maintaining investor-facing documentation. These guidelines are for internal team use only and should not be shared publicly.

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: Potential and current investors
- **Secondary**: Partners and stakeholders interested in the project

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on the "What" Not the "How"
- Describe what the product/service does and its benefits
- Avoid revealing implementation details, algorithms, or technical architecture
- Present capabilities and outcomes rather than methodologies

### 2. Maintain Confidentiality
- Never include sensitive code snippets or logic
- Avoid detailed technical explanations of proprietary processes
- Do not expose internal configurations or system specifics
- Keep competitive advantages abstract

### 3. Professional Investor Communication
- Use clear, business-oriented language
- Focus on value propositions and market opportunities
- Highlight competitive advantages without revealing trade secrets
- Include relevant metrics and achievements when appropriate

### 4. Content Guidelines

#### Do Include:
- High-level product descriptions
- Market positioning and opportunities
- User benefits and use cases
- General technology categories (e.g., "AI-powered" without specifics)
- Business model overview

#### Do NOT Include:
- Source code or code snippets

### 5. Writing Style
- Professional and confident tone
- Concise and clear messaging
- Focus on business value and ROI
- Use visuals sparingly and only when they add value

### 6. Review Process
Before publishing any documentation:
1. Ensure no sensitive information is exposed
2. Verify all claims are accurate but not overly detailed
3. Confirm the content aligns with investor communication standards
4. Get approval from relevant stakeholders

### 7. Security Reminders

- All public documentation should be treated as potentially visible to competitors
- When in doubt, err on the side of less technical detail
