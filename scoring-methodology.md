## Overall Score Calculation

### Weighted Average Method

### Weighted Scoring Algorithm

Our proprietary algorithm combines all component scores using carefully calibrated weights:

- **Liquidity Score**: 25% weight - Market depth and trading accessibility
- **Activity Score**: 20% weight - Trading engagement and participation
- **Momentum Score**: 20% weight - Price trends and market dynamics
- **Community Score**: 15% weight - Holder distribution and growth
- **Security Score**: 15% weight - Smart contract safety and audit results
- **Maturity Score**: 5% weight - Market establishment and stability

The algorithm dynamically adjusts for data availability and applies normalization to ensure consistent scoring across all evaluated tokens.

### Score Interpretation

| Overall Score | Rating | Interpretation |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | High-quality token with strong fundamentals |
| 60-79 | Good | Solid token with positive indicators |
| 40-59 | Moderate | Mixed signals, requires careful evaluation |
| 20-39 | Poor | Significant risks or weaknesses |
| 0-19 | Very Poor | High risk, multiple red flags |

### Investment Guidance

Based on comprehensive analysis, our AI provides clear investment guidance:

- **Strong Buy (80-100)**: High-quality tokens with excellent fundamentals across all metrics
- **Buy (60-79)**: Solid investment opportunities with good underlying strength
- **Hold/Monitor (40-59)**: Mixed signals requiring careful evaluation and timing
- **Avoid (0-39)**: Significant risks outweigh potential opportunities

All recommendations consider both overall score and individual component strength, with particular emphasis on security metrics.

## Data Sources

### Real-time Data Providers
- **BirdEye**: Price, volume, liquidity, trading metrics
- **Moralis**: Holder analytics, distribution data
- **SolSniffer**: Security audits, contract analysis
- **LunarCrush**: Social sentiment (when available)

### Update Frequency
- Price/Volume data: Every 30 seconds
- Holder data: Every 5 minutes
- Security audits: On contract deployment, then cached
- Score recalculation: On data update

## Important Considerations

### Limitations
1. **New Tokens**: May have artificially low scores due to limited history
2. **Manipulation**: Short-term metrics can be gamed
3. **Data Availability**: Not all tokens have complete data
4. **Market Conditions**: Scores don't account for broader market trends

### Best Practices
1. **Use Multiple Metrics**: Don't rely on overall score alone
2. **Check Security First**: Low security score is a red flag regardless of other metrics
3. **Monitor Trends**: Score changes over time are often more informative than absolute values
4. **Verify Data**: Cross-reference with other sources for important decisions
