# AssetSwap: Building AGI for Finance

## Executive Summary

AssetSwap is building the world's first **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) for finance** — a fully autonomous, self-learning system that executes trades, manages portfolios, and adapts to market conditions in real-time. Starting with the meme coin market as our proving ground, we're expanding to become a comprehensive multi-asset, cross-platform AGI integrating with traditional finance by 2026.

### Key Metrics (September 2024)

* **10,000+ orders per day** processing capacity
* **$100K daily volume** (~$3M monthly)
* **1,000+ active traders** on the platform
* **400% month-over-month growth**
* **80% win rate** in token selection over 30 days
* **30% average ROI** for traders following AGI recommendations

### Recognition & Validation
- **Won "Most Promising Startup in AI"** – Dubai MEBA Awards
- **Google Startup Program** – Accepted member
- **$300K+ total volume** in first weeks of beta

## The Evolution: From AI Tools to AGI

### Current State: Agentic AI (Live Now)

AssetSwap has successfully deployed **Phase 1** of our AGI vision:

✅ **24/7 Autonomous Operation** – Executes trades continuously without manual intervention  
✅ **Dynamic Strategy Adaptation** – Adjusts based on real-time market conditions  
✅ **Automated Risk Management** – Implements stop-losses, take-profits, and portfolio adjustments  
✅ **Natural Language Control** – "Buy top 5 meme coins, sell when score < 60"

### Next Frontier: True AGI (2025-2026)

We're building toward complete financial autonomy:

🚧 **Self-Directed Learning** – Improves strategies from wins and losses without human input  
🚧 **Resilience & Error Correction** – Automatically adjusts to avoid repeated mistakes  
🚧 **Cross-Asset Intelligence** – Seamless operation across crypto, stocks, forex, commodities  
🚧 **Predictive Market Modeling** – Anticipates market movements before they happen

## Comparison: AI for Coding vs AGI for Finance

| Stage | AI for Coding | AI for Finance (AssetSwap) |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Basic AI** | GPT generates code, manual copy-paste | GPT answers questions, needs manual data |
| **Connected AI** | Cursor/Windsurf connects LLM to codebase | — |
| **Agentic AI** | AI executes single coding tasks | **AssetSwap Insights** (March 2025): LLM + real-time data |
| **Advanced Agents** | Multi-file editing simultaneously | **AssetSwap Agent** (Live): Execute complex trading strategies |
| **Cloud Agents** | Persistent background development | **Background Trading** (August 2025): Autonomous DCA, rebalancing |
| **AGI** | Self-improving, fully autonomous coding | **Financial AGI** (2026): Self-directed, learning, adapting 24/7 |

## Core Technology

### AI Agent System

**Specialized Trading Agents:**

### Transparent Token Scoring

Our AGI evaluates tokens across five dimensions, producing scores from 0-100:

| Score Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------------|--------|------------------|
| **Liquidity** | 25% | Market depth, trading volume, stability |
| **Activity** | 20% | Trading frequency, unique wallets, buy/sell balance |
| **Community** | 20% | Holder count, distribution health, growth trends |
| **Security** | 25% | Contract audits, risk indicators, safety features |
| **Momentum** | 10% | Price trends, volume changes, trader interest |

**Performance Validation:**
- 80% win rate on recommended tokens over 30 days
- Transparent methodology with exact thresholds published
- Real-time updates from multiple data sources

### Advanced Order Management

**30+ Conditional Triggers Including:**
- Price movements (above/below)
- Volume thresholds
- Holder metrics (whale accumulation)
- AI score changes
- Market cap milestones
- Social sentiment shifts

**Example Order:**
```
"Buy $1000 of TOKEN when security_score > 70 
AND liquidity > $100K, 
sell 50% when price doubles 
OR momentum_score < 40"
```
