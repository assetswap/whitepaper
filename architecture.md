# Architecture

## System Overview

AssetSwap's architecture represents a breakthrough in decentralized trading infrastructure. We seamlessly integrate artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and traditional financial systems into a unified platform that delivers institutional-grade performance with consumer-friendly accessibility.

## High-Level Architecture

Our system employs a modular, microservices-based design organized into six primary layers, each optimized for specific functionality while maintaining seamless inter-layer communication.

The **Frontend Layer** provides multiple user interfaces including web applications, mobile apps, and API access. The **Gateway Layer** manages load balancing, WebSocket connections, and REST API endpoints. The **AI Layer** houses our LangChain router, specialized agents, and machine learning models. The **Business Logic Layer** contains the order engine, trade executor, and risk management systems. The **Blockchain Layer** interfaces with Solana RPC nodes, Jupiter Protocol, and cross-chain bridges. The **Data Layer** comprises MongoDB for persistent storage, Redis for caching, and Pinecone for vector operations.

## Core Components

### Frontend Layer

Our web application utilizes Next.js 14 with TypeScript, delivering server-side rendering for optimal SEO and performance. Real-time market data streams through WebSocket connections, while interactive charting powered by TradingView provides professional-grade analysis tools. The drag-and-drop strategy builder enables users to create complex trading algorithms without coding knowledge.

Mobile applications built with React Native provide full functionality across iOS and Android platforms. Biometric authentication ensures security while push notifications keep users informed of critical market movements. Offline transaction signing and hardware wallet integration provide maximum security for mobile traders.

The API gateway supports both REST and GraphQL protocols, authenticated through JWT tokens with automatic refresh. Rate limiting at 1,000 requests per minute per user prevents abuse while comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 documentation ensures developer accessibility.

### AI Engine Layer

The LangChain router serves as the central nervous system of our AI infrastructure, intelligently directing user requests to specialized agents based on intent classification and historical performance metrics. This dynamic routing ensures optimal response times and accuracy across all query types.

Our specialized agents each excel in specific domains. The AssetSwap general agent handles comprehensive trading operations, portfolio management, and market analysis. The meme token specialist analyzes social sentiment, identifies virality patterns, and calculates risk scores for speculative assets. The Polymarket agent interfaces with prediction markets, calculating probability-adjusted returns and executing hedge strategies. The stock token agent manages tokenized equity positions while ensuring regulatory compliance.

### Order Management System

The order engine supports an extensive array of trigger types beyond simple price conditions. AI-powered score triggers enable trades based on security assessments, liquidity evaluations, and momentum indicators. Market data triggers respond to changes in market capitalization, volume, and holder counts. Advanced triggers detect whale accumulation patterns, social sentiment shifts, and technical breakouts.

Our trigger evaluation service continuously monitors market conditions with one-second polling intervals. Batch processing evaluates 100 orders simultaneously, ensuring scalability while maintaining rapid response times. When triggers activate, the system immediately initiates trade execution through our optimized routing infrastructure.

### Trading Execution Layer

Jupiter integration provides optimal trade execution through intelligent route calculation. The system validates balances, calculates optimal paths across multiple liquidity pools, determines fees with sponsorship options, constructs transactions with MEV protection, and executes trades with automatic retry logic.

Our proprietary smart order router minimizes price impact by splitting large orders across multiple pools. Fee optimization considers both network and protocol costs while commit-reveal schemes protect against MEV attacks. Dynamic slippage adjustment ensures trades complete successfully even during volatile market conditions.

### Blockchain Integration

Multi-chain architecture abstracts blockchain complexity through a unified interface. The Solana connector leverages the network's 65,000 TPS capacity with sub-second finality. EVM connectors support Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and Avalanche through standardized interfaces.

Cross-chain bridge integration enables seamless asset movement between networks. Wormhole Protocol facilitates Solana-EVM transfers while atomic swaps provide trustless cross-chain trades. Liquidity pools maintained on both sides of bridges ensure minimal slippage, while fee abstraction allows users to pay transaction costs in any token.

### Data Management Layer

MongoDB serves as our primary database, storing user profiles, order states, transaction history, conversation logs, and token metadata across sharded collections. This NoSQL approach provides flexibility for rapidly evolving data structures while maintaining query performance.

Redis caching accelerates frequently accessed data with sub-millisecond response times. Session management, rate limiting counters, hot data caching, real-time price feeds, and WebSocket connection states all leverage Redis for optimal performance.

Pinecone vector database enables semantic search capabilities, powering token discovery, similar trader identification, pattern matching for strategies, and AI memory storage. This allows natural language queries to return relevant results regardless of exact keyword matches.

## Security Architecture

### Encryption Service

Our encryption service utilizes Google Cloud KMS for key management with AES-256-GCM encryption. User-specific encryption keys undergo automatic rotation every 30 days. Private keys are encrypted client-side before transmission, ensuring even AssetSwap cannot access user funds.

### Access Control

Multi-layer security protects user accounts and assets. JWT authentication with refresh tokens prevents session hijacking. Role-based access control limits functionality based on user permissions. End-to-end encryption protects sensitive data in transit and at rest. Comprehensive audit logging tracks all operations for compliance and security analysis. Real-time anomaly detection identifies and blocks suspicious activities.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

Our three-tier caching architecture delivers optimal performance across all access patterns. L1 memory cache provides 10ms response times for frequently accessed data. L2 Redis cache serves broader datasets with 50ms latency. L3 CDN cache distributes static content globally with 200ms access times.

Cache invalidation strategies ensure data consistency while maximizing hit rates. Write-through caching updates all levels simultaneously for critical data. Time-based expiration removes stale data automatically. Event-driven invalidation responds to market changes in real-time.

### Load Balancing

Distributed load handling ensures consistent performance under varying demand. Geographic distribution across five regions minimizes latency for global users. Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling responds to traffic spikes within seconds. Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures during service disruptions. Priority queues ensure critical orders execute even during peak loads.

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling

Every component supports horizontal scaling without architectural changes. Stateless services enable unlimited instance replication. Database sharding by user ID distributes data across multiple nodes. Kafka event streaming decouples components for independent scaling. Redis clustering with consistent hashing maintains cache performance at scale.
