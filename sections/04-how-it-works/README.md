# How AssetSwap Works

## User Journey: From Intent to Execution

### Step 1: Natural Language Input
Users express their trading intent in plain English through our interface. No complex order forms, no technical indicators â€“ just describe what you want to achieve.

**Example User Inputs:**
- "Find me the next 100x meme coin"
- "Buy $500 of Bitcoin every Monday"
- "Sell half my position when I'm up 50%"

### Step 2: AI Understanding & Analysis
Our AGI processes the request through multiple layers:

1. **Intent Recognition**: Understanding what the user wants to achieve
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Identifying amounts, conditions, timing
3. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating safety and feasibility
4. **Strategy Formation**: Creating an execution plan

### Step 3: Market Intelligence Gathering
The AGI simultaneously analyzes data from multiple sources:

- **Real-time price feeds** from 20+ exchanges
- **On-chain data** directly from blockchains
- **Social sentiment** from Twitter, Discord, Telegram
- **Historical patterns** from our proprietary database
- **Risk indicators** from security scanners

### Step 4: Decision Making
Based on comprehensive analysis, the AGI makes trading decisions:

- **Opportunity Scoring**: Rates each option from 0-100
- **Risk/Reward Calculation**: Determines optimal position sizing
- **Timing Optimization**: Identifies best entry points
- **Execution Path**: Selects best route for trades

### Step 5: Autonomous Execution
Once decisions are made, the AGI executes automatically:

- **Order Placement**: Submits trades to exchanges/protocols
- **Slippage Protection**: Ensures best possible prices
- **Gas Optimization**: Minimizes transaction costs
- **Confirmation**: Verifies successful execution

### Step 6: Continuous Management
After initial execution, the AGI continues working:

- **Position Monitoring**: Tracks performance 24/7
- **Risk Management**: Implements stops and take-profits
- **Strategy Adjustment**: Adapts to changing conditions
- **Reporting**: Updates users on outcomes
